# PVF-Dataset (PVF-10)
1. This is code and dataset from the paper of "Photovoltaic Fault Dataset (PVF-10): A High-resolution UAV  Thermal Infrared Image Dataset for Fine-grained Photovoltaic Fault Classification "
2. The code and dataset (PVF-10) are on the master branch.
3. Since the weight file of the model is too large, we put it on "pan.baidu.com" for interested researchers at the link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1SfvW7jvkqhF5tu7J-EAzjw; Extract Codeï¼šPVFs
4. Due to the bandwidth limitation of Github large file system GLF, PVF-10 may not be able to be downloaded properly, please move to Baidu.com. Link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LJVe2lkqvYnwTI8cuiESDg; Extract Code: PVFD
