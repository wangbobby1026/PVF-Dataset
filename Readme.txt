# PVF-Dataset (PVF-10)
1. This is code and dataset from the paper of "Photovoltaic Fault Dataset (PVF-10): A High-resolution UAV  Thermal Infrared Image Dataset for Fine-grained Photovoltaic Fault Classification "
2. The code and dataset (PVF-10) are on the master branch.
3. Since the weight file of the model is too large, we put it on "pan.baidu.com" for interested researchers at the link: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1SfvW7jvkqhF5tu7J-EAzjw; Codeï¼šPVFs 

Note: Data provided by the School of Geography and Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences.


train_val.py is the training script.
pre is the test script.
The model folder holds the classification models used in the paper.
The weights folder holds the weights files for the five models in the paper.
